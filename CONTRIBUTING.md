## How Can I Contribute?

There are many ways to contribute, and all are welcome:

### üêõ Reporting Bugs

- **Check existing issues** to see if someone has already reported the same bug.
- If not, open a new issue.

### ‚úçÔ∏è Creating a Module

Modules are the primary way to extend the engine's functionality. They can add new API endpoints, listen to events, or perform background tasks.

#### 1. File Structure

The recommended way to create a module is to add a new directory inside `src/modules/`. The engine will automatically discover it if you follow the conventions.

For a module named `greeter`:
```
+src/
+‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ modules/
    ‚Ä¢‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ greeter/
    ‚Ä¢   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.js       # The module's entry point
    ‚Ä¢   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ greeter-logic.js # (Optional) Other logic files
```
#### 2. The onInit function 
+ The entry point of your module (index.js) must export an async function called onInit :
```javascript
let engine, logger;
export async function onInit(defaultEngine) {
    engine = defaultEngine;
    logger = engine.getComponent(Logger);
    // ...
};
```
### üöÄ Submitting Pull Requests

If you're ready to write code, that's fantastic!

1.  **Find an issue**: Look for issues with the `good first issue` or `help wanted` labels. Comment on the issue to let us know you're working on it.
2.  **Fork the repository** to your own GitHub account.
3.  **Clone your fork** locally: `git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/data-primals-engine.git`
4.  **Create a branch** for your changes: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name` or `fix/bug-description`.
5.  **Make your changes**. Be sure to follow the project's style conventions.
6.  **Start the development server** to test your changes: `npm run dev`.
7.  **Commit your changes** with a clear message: `git commit -m "feat: Add feature X"`. (We follow the Conventional Commits specification).
8.  **Push your branch** to your fork: `git push origin feature/your-feature-name`.
9.  **Open a Pull Request** from your fork to the original repository's `main` branch.
10. **Link your PR** to the corresponding issue.

### üìñ Improving Documentation
